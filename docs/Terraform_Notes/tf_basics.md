## Terraform Basics

### Why I chose Terraform for IaC?
* Modular design, different providers will take care of their modules, developing in terraform feels like playing lego. 
* Multi cloud, you can use terraform to easily provision resources to multiple cloud, for projects that requires e.g. Azure and AWS, terraform has this advantage over native tools like ARM / CloudFormation.  
* Easy to build your own modules and reuse in multiple projects.
